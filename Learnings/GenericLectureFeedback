What I liked in the lecture was that ,Sir has widened our horizon of Computer science and technology by telling us about github, different programming languages, different projects students in different institutions are doing.
What I disliked in the lecture was that there is a confusion created on how we should learn a new programming language in two days and create an app in such short time without  any prior idea or information on how to start. Relying solely on google to do everything seems vague.
